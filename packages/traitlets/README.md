# Jupyter UI Traitlets

🪐 ⚛️ Create UI for your Jupyter Traits

As part of the jupyter-ui components, we also want to ease the creation of user interfaces based on the [Jupyter Traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io).

This will allow a front-end developer to start from the traits (configuration definition) defined in Python code and automatically generate a React.js user interface which can be used to manage your settings in a visual way. The traits would be converted to json-schema definitions that can be used to create the React.js components. This is particularly useful to build management user interfaces.
