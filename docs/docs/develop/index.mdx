# Develop

The Jupyter UI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui). Check out the TypeDoc documentation for [@datalayer/jupyter-react 0.9.0](https://typedoc.datalayer.tech/datalayer/jupyter-react/0.9.0).

:::note

Many developers are reporting issues with their environment (build failures...).

This is inherent to the mixed Python and JavaScript build as dependency on Jupyter toolchain. We are putting this issue at the <b>top of our priority</b> to ease your pain.

1. Pick or `Conda` or `Docker`/`devcontainer` with VS Code based on your pior experience.
1. Only `Yarn v3` and `Lerna` are supported based on JupyterLab 4 requirements.
1. `engines` and `os` are enforced in package.json - We **only support** Yarn v3 on macOS and Linux.
1. We are offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. If you run `yarn start`, you will consume those hosted kernels from the cloud.
1. The default build should be faster and does not build the examples, please give your opinion on https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/63.
1. `Pyodide` kernels are supported for most of the components.
