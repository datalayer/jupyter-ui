# Develop with Jupyter UI

The Jupyter UI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui).

Pick or [Conda](/develop/conda) or [Devcontainers](/develop/devcontainers) with VS Code based on your prior experience.

Datalayer is offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. This is the default setup, so if you run `npm start`, you will consume those hosted
kernels from the cloud.

and idea on how to make a better experience. ❤️
