# Develop

The Jupyter UI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui). Check out the TypeDoc documentation for [@datalayer/jupyter-react 0.9.0](https://typedoc.datalayer.tech/datalayer/jupyter-react/0.9.0).

:::note

Environment is sensible to avoid build failures.

<br />
1. Pick or `Conda` or `Docker`/`devcontainer` with VS Code based on your prior
experience. 1. Datalayer is offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run
your local Jupyter Server. If you run `npm start`, you will consume those hosted
kernels from the cloud.
<br />
👉 Please continue reporting any failure and idea on how to make a better
experience. ❤️
