# Develop

The Jupyter UI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui). Check out the TypeDoc documentation for [@datalayer/jupyter-react 0.9.0](https://typedoc.datalayer.tech/datalayer/jupyter-react/0.9.0).

Pick or [Conda](/develop/conda) or [Devcontainers](/develop/devcontainers) with VS Code based on your prior experience.

Datalayer is offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. This is the default setup, so if you run `npm start`, you will consume those hosted
kernels from the cloud.
