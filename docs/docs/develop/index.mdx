# Develop

The Jupyter UI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui). Check out the TypeDoc documentation for [@datalayer/jupyter-react 0.9.0](https://typedoc.datalayer.tech/datalayer/jupyter-react/0.9.0).

:::note

Environment is sensible to avoid build failures.

1. Pick or `Conda` or `Docker`/`devcontainer` with VS Code based on your pior experience.
1. We are offering `hosted runtimes` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. If you run `npm start`, you will consume those hosted kernels from the cloud.
1. The default build should be faster and does not build the examples, please give your opinion on https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/63.
