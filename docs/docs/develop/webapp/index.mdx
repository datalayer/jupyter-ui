# Web App

You can start an example and hack the source code. The changes will build automatically and will be available in your browser.

```bash
# Start and example defined in the packages/react/webpack.config.js file.
# open http://localhost:3208
npm start
```

This will consume kernels from the Datalayer development free servers in the cloud. If you need your own server (on your local machine or on your cloud), refer to this [Jupyter Server documentation](/docs/deployments/jupyter-server)

We have a variety of examples, pick one in the following commands and enjoy.

```bash
# Run the Vite example
# open http://localhost:3000
npm run jupyter:ui:vite
```

```bash
# Run the Lexical example
# open http://localhost:3208
npm run jupyter:ui:lexical
```

```bash
# Run the Docusaurus example
# open http://localhost:3000/docs/intro
npm run jupyter:ui:docusaurus
```

```bash
# Run the Next.js example
# open http://localhost:3000
npm run jupyter:ui:nextjs
```

While running those example, hot reload is supported:

- Changing the source code of the example and your browser should reflect those changes.
- If you need to change the core react package `@datalayer/jupyter-react`, you will need to run `npm watch` in the `packages/react` folder.
