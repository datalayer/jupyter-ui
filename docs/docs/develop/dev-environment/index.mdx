# Development Environment

:::caution

🚨 Only npm is supported - yarn, pnpm... may work, or not...

For yarn, Create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in the root of your project to use `node_modules`.

```yaml
enableImmutableInstalls: false
enableInlineBuilds: false
enableTelemetry: false
httpTimeout: 60000
nodeLinker: node-modules
npmRegistryServer: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com"

# This will fix the build error with @lerna/legacy-package-management
# See https://github.com/lerna/repro/pull/11
packageExtensions:

      "@lerna/child-process": "*"
      "js-yaml": "*"
      "rimraf": "*"
    peerDependencies:

Choose the way you want to develop Jupyter UI:

1. [With Conda](/docs/develop/dev-environment/conda)
1. [With VS Code Devcontainers](/docs/develop/dev-environment/devcontainers)

Once you have applied the steps described in one of the above 2 options, you are ready to develop following the next steps.

```bash
# Install the dependencies. This will take some time, be patient. 👍
npm install
```

```bash
# Build the source code. This will also take some time, be also patient. 🙂
npm run build
```

If you just want to develop the core package `@datalayer/jupyter-react` of the repository, go to the sub folder and work there.

```bash
cd packages/react
npm run build
```
