# Setup with VS Code Devcontainers

Clone the `jupyter-ui` repository and load it in your VS Code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui.git && \
  cd jupyter-ui && \
  code
```

The [Jupyter UI](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui) repository ships the needed `.devcontainer` folder to develop from [VS Code Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Just click on the bottom-left blue icon in your VS Code and select `Reopen in container...`. Note you may need to up the amount of resources in your dev-container [link](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/101)

:::caution

It may take some time the first time as the Docker container needs to be build.

:::

The bottom-left blue icon should now show `Dev Container: Jupyter UI`. You can now open a `Terminal` from VS Code and run `npm run start`. Double check with a few commands.

```bash
(base) jovyan@c811ff68da4f:/workspaces/ui$ pwd
/workspaces/ui
(base) jovyan@c811ff68da4f:/workspaces/ui$
(base) jovyan@c811ff68da4f:/workspaces/ui$ ls
dev  docs  environment.yml  examples  jest.config.js  lerna.json  LICENSE  Makefile  node_modules  package.json  packages  prettier.config.js  README.md  typedoc.json  ui.code-workspace  yarn.lock
(base) jovyan@c811ff68da4f:/workspaces/ui$
```

You should be ready to develop.

If you want to get back to the original state, click again the the bottom-left blue icon and select `Reopen Folder Locally`.
