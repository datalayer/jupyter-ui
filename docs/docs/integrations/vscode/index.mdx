Websocket binary support: for now we forbid the usage of the newer protocol v1.kernel.websocket.jupyter.org. When using it, the message data are failing to be serialized to be transferred from the webview to the extension. And when receiving it, the deserialization fails. The deserialization error may be related to an incorrect binaryType that is not handle in the current code; but in JupyterLab it is forced to 'arraybuffer' for kernel websocket.
