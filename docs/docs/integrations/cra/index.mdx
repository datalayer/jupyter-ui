# Create React Application

The source code of an example can be found in the [jupyter-react-cra-example repository](https://github.com/datalayer-examples/jupyter-react-cra-example).

## Create a Project

Create a WEB application skeleton based on `create-react-app`.

```bash
npx create-react-app jupyter-react-cra-example -y --template typescript && \
  cd jupyter-react-cra-example
```

## Resolutions

We need coherent React.js versions otherwise you may hit the `Invalid Hook Call Warning` with `mismatching versions of React and React DOM` as documented on [this page](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html).

JupyerLab is actively developed and we are tracking the latest (pre-)releases as closely as possible. Therefor, we ask to pin the npm resolutions. Add [this block](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/blob/main/package.json#L76-L184) in your package.json.

## Startup Scripts

You will need a Jupyter server up-and-running. We ship the configuration and scripts in the [jupyter-react-cra-example repository](https://github.com/datalayer-examples/jupyter-react-cra-example). Copy from that repository the `dev` folder in your project. This will provide you with the correct Jupyter server configuration and with the `content` folder that contains the `ping.ipynb` notebook as other example notebooks.

Now add in your `package.json` the needed scripts and development dependencies.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "run-p -c start:*",
    "start:jupyter": "./dev/sh/start-jupyter-server.sh",
    "start:react": "react-scripts start",
    "kill": "./dev/sh/kill.sh"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "npm-run-all": "4.1.5",
    "buffer": "6.0.3"
  },
```

:::note

The need for `buffer` may be removed depending on upstream JupyterLab evolution.

:::

## Dependencies

Add Jupyter React in `package.json`.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@datalayer/jupyter-react": "0.5.1",
  },
```

Time to install the dependencies (this will take time).

```bash
npm install
```

## Metadata

You need to add in the `<head/>` section of `public/index.html` the metadata to indicate where you Jupyter server is running, as the `require` javascript.

```html
    <script id="datalayer-config-data" type="application/json">
      {
        "jupyterServerUrl": "https://oss.datalayer.run/api/jupyter-server",
        "jupyterServerToken": "60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6"
      }
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.4/require.min.js"></script>
```

## Dot Env

It looks like the `create-react-app` version 5 does not like sourcemaps pointing to non existing source code. To avoid error messages, please create a `.env` file at the top of your folder/repositoriy and add there `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`.

```dotenv
// .env
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

## Application

Update `src/App.tsx` to import the `Jupyter` and `Notebook` component and change the App like this.

```ts
// App.tsx
import { Notebook, Jupyter } from "@datalayer/jupyter-react";

function App() {
  return (
    <Jupyter>
      <Notebook path="ping.ipynb" />
    </Jupyter>
  )
}

export default App;
```

## Strict Mode

We don't support yet [React Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html) (can be useful in development mode). Please remove any reference of `StrictMode` in the `./src/index.tsx` file, your call to `render` should look like this.

```ts
// index.tsx
root.render(
  <App />
);
```

## Start

:::success

We get there!

:::

Let's get started and enjoy a Notebook in React.js.

```bash
# echo open http://localhost:3000
npm run start
```

:::caution

Run `npm run kill` before restarting as `CTRL-C` may leave ghost servers.
