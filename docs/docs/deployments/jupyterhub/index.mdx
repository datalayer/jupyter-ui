# JupyterHub

JupyterHub deployment for Jupyter UI is currently under development and needs community contributions to complete the integration.

## Current Status

Jupyter UI components are compatible with JupyterHub's authentication system since `@datalayer/jupyter-react` is built as a Jupyter Server extension. Initial proof-of-concept deployments have been successful, but complete documentation and production-ready configurations are still in progress.

## Known Working Approach

Based on community experimentation ([#191](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/191)), the following approach has been validated:

### 1. Install Jupyter UI

```bash
cd /path/to/jupyter-ui
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure JupyterHub

Update your `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
# Set the default landing page to Jupyter UI
c.Spawner.default_url = '/jupyter_react'

# Configure the single-user app (if needed)
c.Spawner.environment = {
    'JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP': 'jupyter_react.serverextension'
}
```

### 3. Launch and Access

The Jupyter UI application will be accessible at:

```
http://your-jupyterhub-domain/jupyter_react
```

## Known Limitations

- **Base URL Handling**: Some JavaScript assets may not load correctly with custom base URLs. The `index.html` template needs updates to properly include JupyterHub's `base_url`.
- **Asset Paths**: Static assets may require path adjustments in production configurations.
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Setup steps need to be fully documented and tested across different JupyterHub configurations.

## Integration Options

Several approaches are being explored:

### Option 1: JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP

Use JupyterHub's environment variable to specify a custom application:

```python
c.Spawner.environment = {
    'JUPYTERHUB_SINGLEUSER_APP': 'your.custom.module'
}
```

### Option 2: Custom Spawner

Create a custom spawner that launches Jupyter UI. See:

- [JupyterHub Spawners Documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/spawners.html)
- [jhub-apps](https://github.com/nebari-dev/jhub-apps) - Modern launcher integration

### Option 3: Proxy Integration

Use JupyterHub's configurable HTTP proxy to serve Jupyter UI alongside other services.

## We Need Your Help! 🙋

This deployment method needs community contributions to become production-ready. We're looking for help with:

### 🐛 Testing & Bug Reports

- Test Jupyter UI with different JupyterHub configurations (Docker, Kubernetes, bare metal)
- Report issues with authentication, base URL handling, or asset loading
- Validate the setup on different operating systems and environments

### 📝 Documentation

- Document step-by-step installation procedures
- Create configuration examples for common setups
- Write troubleshooting guides based on real deployment experiences

### 💻 Code Contributions

- Fix base URL handling in templates
- Improve static asset path resolution
- Add JupyterHub-specific configuration options
- Create example Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- Create Docker images with Jupyter UI + JupyterHub
- Build example deployment configurations (docker-compose, k8s manifests)
- Test with different authentication providers (OAuth, LDAP, etc.)
