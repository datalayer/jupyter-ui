# Support

The easiest way to get support on a specific open source component is to open an [issue](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues) for questions, feature requests, bug reports... We also welcome [Pull Requests](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/pulls).

You can also send feedback or question to our [X account](https://x.com/DatalayerIO).

:::info

If you'd like more like priority handling of issues, regular calls... we offer sponsoring options with the [GitHub sponsoring program](https://github.com/sponsors/datalayer). For closer interactions, we also offer support contracts. Please send a mail to <a href="mailto:support@datalayer.io?subject=Please contact me for support&body=I'd like to know more about your support options.">support at datalayer.io</a> to know more.

If those options does not fit your requirements or you are not comfortable sharing information in public, see other options on the [Datalayer support page](https://datalayer.tech/docs/services/support) or book a call to discuss, we are here to help!
