The Jupyter UI components support:

- Predefined Zustand actions.
- Everything is created in a single React tree to ensure Jupyter UI components can use any context created by the host application.
- IPyWidgets and Panel interactive widgets are supported.
- Collaborative RTC is also supported.
- Plays nice with Primer React, Material-UI, Storybook, Docusaurus, Styled Components, Emotion.js... and many other standard libraries.
- A React.js context for Authentication, Authorization and Theming.
- Benefits from current and new JupyterLab development, eg edit mode navigation, colored-collapser, collaborative cursor.
