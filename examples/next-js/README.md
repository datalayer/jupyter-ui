# Jupyter UI for Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Read more on the [Datalayer documentation website](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech/docs/examples/next-js) (ensure you have tne needed [Setup](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech/docs/develop/setup)).

## Getting Started

> You have to use Yarn V3 to make this work.

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can create a static version of the application that you will find under the `out` folder.

```bash
yarn build
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
